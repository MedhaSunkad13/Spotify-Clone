# Spotify-Clone
I have created a Spotify Clone using only HTML and CSS. 

This project allowed me to become more familiar with various CSS properties and how they can be applied to build responsive and visually appealing web pages.

By focusing on HTML and CSS alone, I was able to deepen my understanding of layout techniques, styling strategies, and best practices for web development.

This foundational knowledge will be instrumental as I move on to more complex projects that may incorporate JavaScript, frameworks, and other advanced technologies.
